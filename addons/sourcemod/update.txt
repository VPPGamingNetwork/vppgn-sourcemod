		"Notes"	"Added Cvar sm_vpp_spec_ad_period to play adverts to spectators on a set period (In minutes), Default = 3, Min = 3, 0 = Disabled."
		"Notes"	"Fixed a couple of issues where Radio would not resume correctly & Fixed a rare case where adverts could resume for players who were not listening it."
		"Notes"	"Remove adverts at round end / freezetime being a "Good" period, it apppers to have caused a couple of complaints that it was disturbing players."
